Useful additions to inbuilt [fs] module.<br>
ðŸ“¦ [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-fs),
ðŸ“œ [Files](https://unpkg.com/extra-fs/),
ðŸ“° [Docs](https://nodef.github.io/extra-fs/).

This package provides **async versions of functions** (in addition to the
existing *sync* and *callback*-based functions) in the inbuilt [fs] module,
exposed as `*Async()` from the `fs.promises` namespace. They can be used with
`Promise`-based asynchronous programming using the `await` keyword. In addition,
**callback-based functions**, such as [readFile], also **behave as async functions**
when a *callback* is **not provided**. The idea behind using `*Async()` function
names is to provide a **flat module**.

In addition, convenience functions such as [readFileText] and [readJson] are
included. For performing file/directory **existence check** *async* [exists],
[assertExists], and [assertNotExists] can be used. **Cleanup** of *one-item outer*
*directories* can be performed with [dehuskdir]. This package previously included
`which()`, which is now instead suitably included in [extra-child-process]
package.

> Stability: [Experimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1j93RnIxEo).

```javascript
const fs = require('extra-fs');


// 1. Read file text.
async function example1() {
  var text = fs.readFileTextSync('.npmignore');
  var text = await fs.readFileText('.npmignore');
  // â†’ # Source only
  // â†’ .gitmodules
  // â†’ .github/
  // â†’ .docs/
  // â†’ ...
}
example1();


// 2. Read JSON file.
async function example2() {
  var json = fs.readJsonSync('package.json');
  var json = await fs.readJson('package.json');
  // â†’ {
  // â†’   name: 'extra-fs',
  // â†’   version: '3.0.27',
  // â†’   description: 'Useful additions to inbuilt fs module.',
  // â†’   ...
  // â†’ }
}
example2();


// 3. Assert that a file exists.
async function example3() {
  if (!(await fs.exists('LICENSE'))) throw 'May I see you license sir?';
  await fs.assertExists('LICENSE');
}
example3();


// 4. Get contents of a directory.
async function example4() {
  var contents = fs.readdirSync('src');
  var contents = await fs.readdir('src');
  // â†’ [
  // â†’   'index.ts',
  // â†’   'promises.ts',
  // â†’   '_all.ts',
  // â†’   ...
  // â†’ ]
}
example4();
