Useful additions to inbuilt [fs] module.<br>

The **file system** we use today has its origins in the [UNIX file system]. A
**file** is simply a *chunk of data (bytes)*. Each file has a *locally unique*
*name* and *associated properties* which can be grouped together in a *hierarchy*
of *directories*. A **directory** is a *list of files* and *other directories*,
and has a *parent directory* (except the *root directory* `/`). Given the
tree-structure, a file can be uniquely identified by its **full path**.

Access to a file is provided by the file system though the use of a **file**
**descriptor**. This can be obtained from [open] by providing the *file path*, and
*open mode (read/write)*. Once a file has been opened and necessary operations
performed, such as reading it with [read] or writing to it with [write], it
should be *closed* with [close]. Reading or writing *multiple blocks* of a file at a
time can be achieved with [readv] and [writev]. Once data is written to a file
beyond it current size, it is *automatically expanded*. However, to reduce the
size of a file (i.e., to *truncate* it), [ftruncate] is used. The **additional**
**properties** attached to a file, such as *access/update time*, *access permissions*,
or *ownership* of a file can be obtained with [fstat], and updated with [futimes],
[fchmod], and [fchown] respectively.

**Convenience methods** for accessing a file can also be used, which do not require
us to go through the process of *opening* and *closing* files, and meticulously
reading it or writing to it in blocks. These include [readFile], [writeFile],
[appendFile], [truncate], [stat], [utimes]. [chmod] and [chown] are applicable
or directories as well. A file can be opened as a **stream** for reading with
[createReadStream] and for writing with [createWriteStream], and copied to
another path with [copyFile]. Access to a file or directory can be checked with
[access], renamed/moved with [rename], copied to another path (recursively) with
[cp], and removed (recursively) with [rm].

Similar to opening/closing of a file, a **directory** can be *opened* (to read its
contents) with [opendir], and *read* with [readdir]. A *new directory* can be
created with [mkdir], and an *empty directory* can be *removed* with [rmdir] (a
non-empty directory can be recursively removed with [rm]). A *temporary directory*
(with a unique random suffix) can be created with [mkdtemp]. Changes to a file
or dierctory can be *observed* with [watch].

The file system also provides **symbolic links** and **hard links** which simply *point*
to an *existing file or directory*. *Symbolic (or soft) links* point to a file or
directory through its *path*, while *hard links* point *directly* to the file.
Therefore *renaming/moving* or *removing* the *original file* makes symbolic links
**dangling** (pointing to *non-existent file*, and thus will *not* work) but hard links
*continue to work* (think of them as *shared pointers* to a memory block). A *hard*
*link* can be *created* with [link], and a *symbolic link* (also called *symlink*) with
[symlink]. Note that *symlinks* are basically files containing the *path* of target
file or directory, and this path can be *read* with [readlink]. The *full path* of a
symlink can be *resolved* with [realpath]. *Hard links* point directly to files, and
thus do not have a *"target"* path. The *additional properties* attached to a
symlink, such as *access/update time*, or *ownership* of the symlink can be obtained
with [lstat], and updated with [lutimes], and [lchown] respectively. The *access*
*permissions* of a symlink *cannot* be changed.

This package provides **async versions of functions** (in addition to the
existing *sync* and *callback*-based functions) in the inbuilt [fs] module,
exposed as `*Async()` from the `fs.promises` namespace. They can be used with
`Promise`-based asynchronous programming using the `await` keyword. In addition,
**callback-based functions**, such as [readFile], also **behave as async functions**
when a *callback* is **not provided**. The idea behind using `*Async()` function
names is to provide a **flat module**.

In addition, convenience functions such as [readFileText], [writeFileText],
[readJson] and [writeJson] are included. For performing file/directory
**existence check** *async* [exists], [assertExists], and [assertNotExists] can
be used. **Cleanup** of *one-item outer directories* (which are usually
created upon extracting a compressed file) can be performed with [dehuskdir].
This package previously included `which()`, which is now instead suitably
included in [extra-child-process] package.

```javascript
const fs = require('extra-fs');


// 1. Read file text.
async function example1() {
  var text = fs.readFileTextSync('.npmignore');
  var text = await fs.readFileText('.npmignore');
  // â†’ # Source only
  // â†’ .gitmodules
  // â†’ .github/
  // â†’ .docs/
  // â†’ ...
}
example1();


// 2. Read JSON file.
async function example2() {
  var json = fs.readJsonSync('package.json');
  var json = await fs.readJson('package.json');
  // â†’ {
  // â†’   name: 'extra-fs',
  // â†’   version: '3.0.27',
  // â†’   description: 'Useful additions to inbuilt fs module.',
  // â†’   ...
  // â†’ }
}
example2();


// 3. Assert that a file exists.
async function example3() {
  if (!(await fs.exists('LICENSE'))) throw 'May I see you license sir?';
  await fs.assertExists('LICENSE');
}
example3();


// 4. Get contents of a directory.
async function example4() {
  var contents = fs.readdirSync('src');
  var contents = await fs.readdir('src');
  // â†’ [ 'index.ts' ]
}
example4();
